        Hi, I’m <strong>Denisa Lovin</strong>, the heart and soul behind <strong>Lovin Fitness!</strong> 💕  
        Fitness isn’t just what I do—it’s who I am. My passion for movement, strength, and empowerment started in middle school when I realized how much I loved fitness.  
      </p>

      <h2 style={{ marginTop: "30px", color: "#ff4a6e" }}>💖 My Mission</h2>
      <p style={{ maxWidth: "600px", margin: "auto", fontSize: "16px", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        Far too many women feel intimidated by the gym, overwhelmed by where to start, or discouraged by the male-dominated fitness space. I’ve seen this my whole life, and that’s why I’ve made it my mission to **help women everywhere** build confidence and discover a love for fitness—**wherever they are.**  
        <br /><br />

        **Staying active makes you feel strong, confident, and empowered.** And I want to help **you** experience that.  
      </p>

        <br /><br />
        Self-defense is more than just learning how to fight—it’s about **feeling secure in your own body** and having the confidence to protect yourself if needed. My programs focus on:
